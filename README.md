# SevenGuis

This is an implementation in Elixir of the [7 GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/) benchmark, using the Erlang module `:wx` to provide native GUI bindings.

These aren't the prettiest GUI implementations, as I'm not aiming to produce polished designs -- this is an exercise in practicing building native GUI apps in Elixir.

## Roadmap

- [x] Counter
- [x] Temperature Converter
- [x] Flight Booker
- [x] Timer
- [x] CRUD
- [x] Circle Drawer
- [ ] Cells
